Sprint 7 Planning:
For this sprint we planned to work on the adult and child factories, polish up the
inspector tests, and work on the pill store, store tests, and demo class. The Demo 
is probably by far the hardest class we've had to write, so we assigned it to 3 people 
from different sub teams, so that we could see some real collarboration across our
team as a whole. Hannah, Ella and Sashe are assigned the Demo. We also had to make
some changed towards the end of the sprint and reassign some tasks because some of
our group members were very busy this week. This sprint is probably the most important
one, so we met on Thursday April 27th and Friday April 28th to work on this together.

Sprint Review:

Sprint Retrospective:
     What went well?
     What could have gone better?
     What will we try next?
     What Questions do we have?

Ella:
     What went well?
        -> The best part of this sprint was the demo and store. We had 3 people from 3
            groups working on the demo, Hannah, Sashe and I. It actually went so perfectly
            and the demo ended up amazing (at least in my opinion). Hannah did the bulk of
            the work for it because they have good initiative, and Sashe put a lot of work
            into debugging the demo and fixing the SoftGelPillStore so that the demo would
            run smooth. I went in and added some style changes and fixed several testing
            errors that cropped up after working on the demo and store. It was a team effort, 
            especially seeing that we did most of the work for it during the weekend when we
            were fairly busy.
     What could have gone better?
        -> 100% communication
     What will we try next?
        -> Nothing, because we're finally done, yay!
     What Questions do we have?
        -> I don't have any questions currently, other than wanting to know if we're going 
            to get a good grade. 

Hannah:
     What went well?
          -> I really enjoyed making the bulk of the demo. 
          We had 3 people all contribute to the demo, Sashe,
          Ella and I all worked on it together. The demo came together really well in the end.
          It was all a team effort fixing other bugs that were in the softgellpills, and in the tests.
     What could have gone better?
          -> Communication.
     What will we try next?
          -> If we ever have a project that is similar to thing make sure our group members don't mute the chat.
     What Questions do we have?
          -> I do not have any questions.
Tayo:
     What went well?
          -> Ultimately creativity with the Demo was a big part of this sprint and it was really cool discussing ideas about it.
     What could have gone better?
          -> Honestly I could have done better with communication and getting my tasks done earlier so that issues that arise can be solved earlier, which would have saved a lot of stress for the whole group. 
     What will we try next?
          -> If we were to do this project again I think having a mid sprint meet to talk about what still needs to be done and discuss any blockers that may prevent us from working, both related and unrelated to the project.
     What Questions do we have?
          -> I don't really have any questions.

Sashe:
     What went well? 
     -> Working on the Store and Demo went pretty smoothly despite there being some challenges. I got some assistance
     on the Store with our overseer (Hannah), and the Demo came together really well. Hannah and Ella did a great job on it!
     What could have gone better? Communication. 
     -> It was difficult to get others to respond.
     What will we try next?
     -> There is no next part, but I think this project has taught us a lot about team coding.
     What Questions do we have?
     -> None

Collin:
     What went well?
     -> The creativity and the clean up aspects were great. I went through and changed 
     and updated all of the classes headings as well as added comments and continued 
     formatting throughout to make sure all classes followed the same header formatting. 
     What could have gone better?
     -> I think while the group does a great job at supporting one another, part of this 
     sprint was filled with spontaneity and with the loose planning since it was our last 
     sprint, we had much more work left to do on the weekend. Because I was 
     out of town over the weekend I was not able to get to support the group the way I would 
     have if I was in Boone. We all put in vast effort throughout this entire project and 
     while the ending is important, I think the work I have put in cannot be discounted and 
     the effort I showed while I was available during this sprint shows my continued dedication.
     What will we try next?
     -> Nothing, since the project is completed. 
     What Questions do we have?
     -> No questions from me.
